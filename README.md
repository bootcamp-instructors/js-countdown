# JavaScript (Final) Countdown

A bit more of a challenge than a digital clock!

## Suggestions for making it your own:
```
* Style it as you wish, obvs.
* Accept user input for length of timer.
* Stop the timer when countdown reaches 0.
* PLAY THE SONG.
* Audible alert when countdown reaches 0.
```
